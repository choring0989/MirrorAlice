 This game was made at Game Jam 2 days and 1 night. <br>

Jump-Space <br>
Ladder climbing and lever pulling -q <br>
Move up -s and down <br>
Move down -w and up key <br>
Move right -a and left <br>
Move left -d and right <br>
Hidden ending -m (mind's M) <br>
Strategy-Talk to Cheshire the Stage 1 and open the door to the next stage. <br> <br>

If you go to the 2nd stage, step on the jump step and climb the air block to pull the lever. A hidden door appears. Whenever the lever is pulled, blocks that can be stepped on are swapped. (If you pull the lever for the first time, you cannot step on the stone block, you can only step on the water block.) <br> <br>

and you can see the ending 'anytime' by pressing the M key. But when your character is alive...
